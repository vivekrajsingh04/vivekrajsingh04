# Vivek Raj Singh

Machine Learning Engineer | Quantitative Modeling | Systems Engineering

I build production-grade ML and quantitative systems with a focus on statistical rigor, reproducibility, and performance.

## Current Focus

- Financial time-series forecasting and risk-aware modeling
- Applied machine learning for decision systems
- High-performance backend and runtime engineering in Rust
- Reliable MLOps workflows for experimentation and deployment

## Technical Strengths

- **Languages:** Python, Rust, C++, SQL, JavaScript
- **ML/Stats:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, statistical modeling
- **Systems:** Linux, Git, concurrency/performance debugging
- **Infra:** AWS, backend service integration

## Open-Source Work

- **MoFA Runtime (Merged):** fixed lock-across-await contention in message bus paths and added regression tests  
  https://github.com/mofa-org/mofa/pull/224
- **MoFA Runtime (In Review):** periodic execution API for `AgentRunner` (Task 16, phase 1)  
  https://github.com/mofa-org/mofa/pull/260
- **MoFA Studio (In Review):** Task 15 phase 1 runtime backend abstraction + practical example + tests  
  https://github.com/mofa-org/mofa-studio/pull/39
