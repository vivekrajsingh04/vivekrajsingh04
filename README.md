# Vivek Raj Singh

Machine Learning Engineer | Quantitative Modeling | Systems Engineering

I build production-grade ML and quantitative systems with a focus on statistical rigor, reproducibility, and performance.  
My work spans forecasting pipelines, model evaluation, and systems-level implementation in Rust and Python.

## Current Focus

- Financial time-series forecasting and risk-aware modeling
- Applied machine learning for decision systems
- High-performance backend and runtime engineering in Rust
- Reliable MLOps workflows for experimentation and deployment

## Technical Strengths

- **Languages:** Python, Rust, C++, SQL, JavaScript  
- **ML/Stats:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, classical statistical modeling  
- **Systems:** Linux, Git, performance/debugging workflows  
- **Infra:** AWS, backend service integration

## Selected Work

- **Modeling Pipeline:** End-to-end forecasting workflow with feature engineering, backtesting, and evaluation  
- **Systems Implementation:** Rust-based components for low-latency and memory-safe execution  
- **Open-Source Contributions:** Active contributions to AI-agent/runtime repositories

## Open Source

I contribute to projects in agent systems, runtime architecture, and ML tooling.
